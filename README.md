eShop Project
This is @Kelvinintech. This is the first time I created a project using React and Firebase. It was a great learning experience, and I plan to continue creating more projects using these technologies to better my skills.

Technologies Used
React: For building the user interface and managing the component lifecycle.
Firebase: For handling authentication, real-time database interactions, and hosting.
Project Overview
The eShop project is designed to simulate an online shopping experience. It features a user-friendly interface where users can browse products, add items to their shopping basket, and proceed to checkout.

Key Features
Product Display: View a list of products with details such as title, image, price, and rating.
Shopping Basket: Add items to the basket and view them in a separate section.
Checkout Process: Simulate the checkout process with a summary of the items in the basket.
Learning Experience
Building this project was an incredible learning opportunity. It was my first time working on a complete React application, and I gained valuable experience in:

React Components: Understanding how to build and manage components.
State Management: Using React hooks and context to manage state across the application.
Firebase Integration: Implementing Firebase for authentication and real-time database functionality.
Feel free to customize it further based on your specific experiences and insights from the project.
