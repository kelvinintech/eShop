# eShop

Welcome to the eShop project! This is a complete e-commerce web application built using React and Firebase. This project was my first complete React project, and it has been a fantastic learning experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing the component lifecycle.
- **Firebase**: For handling authentication, real-time database interactions, and hosting.

## Project Overview

The eShop project is designed to simulate an online shopping experience. It features a user-friendly interface where users can browse products, add items to their shopping basket, and proceed to checkout. 

### Key Features

- **Product Display**: View a list of products with details such as title, image, price, and rating.
- **Shopping Basket**: Add items to the basket and view them in a separate section.
- **Checkout Process**: Simulate the checkout process with a summary of the items in the basket.

## Learning Experience

Building this project was an incredible learning opportunity. It was my first time working on a complete React application, and I gained valuable experience in:

- **React Components**: Understanding how to build and manage components.
- **State Management**: Using React hooks and context to manage state across the application.
- **Firebase Integration**: Implementing Firebase for authentication and real-time database functionality.
